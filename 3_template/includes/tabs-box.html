					<h3>Service Scalability</h3>
					<p>Our custom-built cloud hosting platform allows your websites to grow as much as they need to. Scalability is ensured because all services are taken care of by a few machines instead of just one. This way, you will be able to use as many resources as you need and will never be affected by server load issues or slow maintenance procedures. Also, you can upgrade your plan with additional services at any given moment or move to a more powerful web hosting plan.
